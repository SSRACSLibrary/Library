      <p>Google Scholaris a freely accessible web search enginethat indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly
        literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines. Released in beta in November 2004, the Google
        Scholar index includes peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and
        dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports, and other scholarly literature, including court opinions
        and Google Scholar uses a web crawler, or web robot, to identify files for inclusion in the search results. For
        content to be indexed in Google Scholar, it must meet certain specified criteria. An earlier statistical
        estimate published in PLOS One using a mark and recapture method estimated approximately 79–90% coverage of all
        articles published in English with an estimate of 100 million. This estimate also determined how many documents
        were freely available on the internet. Google Scholar has been criticized for not vetting journals and for
        including predatory journals in its index.
